# for Reverse the number 
 rev=(rev*10)+num%10;
 num=num/10;

 # Short Trick for Digits in number
 log10(num)+1

 #left Shift a number it will be multi by 2
 #right shift a number it will divide by 2  

 #in Binary Search we do start+(end-start) /2  to find middle
 this is because it may happen that start + end value may exceed the range of int in java
 it may happen that start and end value are too large that they exceed the range so to avoid
 that error we have this way to calc mid
