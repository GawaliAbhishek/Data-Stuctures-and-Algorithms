Stream API was introduced in java 1.8 
these streams are realted to collection framework.These is diffrent from io stream
Stream API basically performs bulk opretions and proccess the objects of collection
Stream reduce the code 

List.of() creates a list of given elements but it is immutable we cannot do add() in it 

list.stream() - is used to get stream instance
stream has various methods such as map filter which take lambda boolean function 
.collect is used to collect the filtered elements and collectors.toList() to convert them in list

Stream is also used in group of objects
example - Arrays class also have .stream() method

Stream.of(arrayy)= will give the stream of that array
Stream.forEach(e ->{System.out.println(e)}) is used to print all elements in stream

methods to create Stream objects

1. empty Stream
Stream<Object> s1=Stream.empty();

2.from given some value
int arr[]={2,4,7,9,1};
Stream<Integer> s2=Stream.of(arr);

3.from builder pattern
Stream<Object> s3=Stream.builder().build();

Map method

map method is used to access and perform opretions on every element of the stream
map doest take boolean predicate it takes the Function and map do not filter the elemet
perform opretion and return that element
